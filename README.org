* byte
	An Org-based language/framework for structuring thought
** Conventions
*** Use symbols/hieroglyphics for concepts and connect them to historical/spiritual roots
** Problems
*** Balance byte-usage
**** TODO if you write too much byte, it tells you to stop 
		 potentially implemented through [[Hank-based byte coach]]
*** Allow for chaos
**** TODO function/keybinding for inserting chaos?
		 a la [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454][never use regexes for html parsing]]
**** Ritual(s) for allowing time and experiences to pass by without capturing them
		 i.e. I haven't written byte in months/years, so my files are all out of date. What next? Let it go
** Ideas
*** Hank-based byte coach
*** byte-size mindfulness
*** byte communities
		Weekly meeting with social rules, oral byte discussion
** Inspirations
*** How Emotions are Made: the Secret Life of the Brain
		by Lisa Feldman Barrett
*** You Are Here
		by Thich Nhat Hanh
